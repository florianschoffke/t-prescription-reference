# Reference Implementation for a Webservice

This repository should demonstrate the basic functionality of a webservice that can be used to receive prescription data which then is retrieved by a web client.

Each file represents an entity of the system:
* [Webserver with Endpoints](./t-server.py)
* [Database Service](./t-database.py)
* [OAuth Service for Web ](./t-oatuh.py)

All of the information is simplified to only demonstrate the rough workflow.
